              <b><a href="https://github.com/nurlansu/hugo-sustain">JOUR 5000 Intro to Digital Communication Analytics</a></b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This course explores the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie techniques for extracting useful information and knowledge from digital communication data. The primary goal of the course is to help you come to view problems from a data perspective and understand how to systematically and critically analyze such problems. Data-analytic thinking can be applied in a variety of ways, from social media marketing and analysis to customer relationship management, strategic communication through the field of public relations and advertising, to data-driven decision-making and much more. Throughout this course it is critical that students come to an understanding of the nature of data and its significance for society. With this in mind, the course will focus on introducing technical data skills (acquire, manage, analyze, &amp; use) within both a social and societal context.
