          <strong><a href="#">Project 1</a></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;JOUR 5000. This course explores the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie techniques for extracting useful information and knowledge from digital communication data. The primary goal of the course is to help you come to view problems from a data perspective and understand how to systematically and critically analyze such problems. Data-analytic thinking can be applied in a variety of ways, from social media marketing and analysis to customer relationship management, strategic communication through the field of public relations and advertising, to data-driven decision-making and much more. Throughout this course it is critical that students come to an understanding of the nature of data and its significance for society. With this in mind, the course will focus on introducing technical data skills (acquire, manage, analyze, &amp; use) within both a social and societal context.

          <strong><a href="#">Project 2</a></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;JOUR 5251. This course explores the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie quantitative analytics and statistical most frequently used by digital communication analysts. The primary goal of the course is to help you develop competence and confidence in selecting and applying quantitative methods and then in interpreting and reporting quantitative findings in language that is easily understood so that stakeholders can readily apply those findings. Further, students will continue the work they began in JOUR 5000 by building on their critical thinking skills and their understanding of the structures and characteristics of different types of data.

          <strong><a href="#">Project 3</a></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;JOUR 5261.  This course explores the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie qualitative analytics and methods most frequently used by digital communication analysts. The primary goal of the course is to help you develop competence and confidence in selecting and applying qualitative methods and then in interpreting and reporting qualitative findings in language that is easily understood so that stakeholders can readily apply those findings. Further, students will continue the work they began in JOUR 5000, and if relevant JOUR 5251, by building on their critical thinking skills and their understanding of the structures and characteristics of different types of data. Throughout this course it is critical that students come to an understanding of the variety of forms that data can assume, the many increasing ways in which data can be modeled and conceptualized, and the virtually limitless sources of data available to the digital communication analyst.

          <strong><a href="#">Project 4</a></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;JOUR 5331.This course explores the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie social media analytics and statistical most frequently used by digital communication analysts. The primary goal of the course is to help you develop competence and confidence in selecting and applying social media methods and then in interpreting and reporting social media findings in language that is easily understood so that stakeholders can readily apply those findings. Further, students will continue the work they began in previous course curriculum by building on their critical thinking skills and their understanding of the structures and characteristics of different types of data.

          <strong><a href="#">Project 5</a></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;JOUR 5341. This course explores the latest industry tools, techniques and applications in the field of digital communication analytics. The purpose of this course is to help students develop competence and confidence in selecting and applying tools and techniques in alternative and innovative ways not usually undertaken by analysts. Further, students will continue to build their critical thinking skills through thought experiments during the entirety of the course.

          <strong><a href="#">Project 6</a></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;JOUR 5581 The Capstone seminar in Digital Communication Analytics involves an intensive research project focused on a topic within digital communication analytics. Students learn how to demonstrate mastery of key theoretical concepts and professional analytical principles, research methods and report-writing approaches. Students review relevant scholarly and professional literature, apply selected methodological approaches to a topic, and then write a research paper that articulates and supports a thesis. The majority of the work for this class is conducted independently with regular consultation with instructor. Course serves as a research seminar that enables students to develop own ideas and frameworks through actively engaging with classmates via peer feedback.
